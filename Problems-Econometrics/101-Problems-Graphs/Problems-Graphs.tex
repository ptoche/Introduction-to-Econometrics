\begin{itemize}
\item[] Get quarterly data on the GDP for the United States, going back to 1960 and up to the latest available observation. 
\item<1-> Make a time series plot of both nominal and real GDP for the years 1970-1979, with both series normalized to start at the same value in 1970. Use a logarithmic scale.
\item<1-> Compute the growth rate for each quarter. Compute the annualized growth rate for each quarter. Plot the two series on the same axes.
