Consider the IV regression model
\begin{align*}
Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{i} + \beta_{2} W_{i} + u_{i}
\end{align*}
where $X_{i}$ is correlated with $u_{i}$ and $Z_{i}$ is an instrument. Suppose that the first three assumptions are satisfied. 
\begin{enumerate}
\setbeamertemplate{enumerate item}{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item<1-> $\exp[u_{i}|W_{1i},\ldots,W_{ri}]=0$;
\item<1-> $(X_{1i},\ldots,X_{ki},W_{1i},\ldots,W_{ri},Z_{1i},\ldots,Z_{mi},Y_{i})$ are i.i.d. draws from their joint distribution;
\item $X$, $W$, $Z$, and $Y$ have non-zero finite fourth moments (outliers unlikely);
\end{enumerate}
Which IV assumption is not satisfied when:
\begin{enumerate}
\item<1-> $Z_{i}$ is independent of $(Y_{i}, X_{i}, W_{i})$?
\item<1-> $Z_{i}=W_{i}$?
\item<1-> $W_{i}=1$ for all $i$?
\item<1-> $Z_{i}=X_{i}$?
\end{enumerate}

Which IV assumption is not satisfied when:

\begin{enumerate}

\item $Z_{i}$ is independent of $(Y_{i}, X_{i}, W_{i})$?
\begin{answer}
The instrument relevance condition $\cov(Z_{i},X_{i})\neq0$ is not satisfied since the independence of $(Z_{i},X_{i})$ implies $\cov(Z_{i},X_{i})=0$.
\end{answer}

\item $Z_{i}=W_{i}$?

\begin{answer}
The first-stage regression suffers from perfect multicollinearity since $Z$ cannot be both a regressor and used as an instrument. 
\end{answer}

\item $W_{i}=1$ for all $i$?

\begin{answer}
Since $W$ is constant, the regression has no controls. The regression could suffer from an omitted variable bias, but omitting controls does not violate the IV assumptions.
\end{answer}

\item $Z_{i}=X_{i}$?

\begin{answer}
The instrument exogeneity condition $\cov(Z_{i},u_{i})=0$ is not satisfied since $X_{i}=Z_{i}$ is correlated with $u_{i}$ and therefore $\cov(Z_{i},u_{i})\neq0$.
\end{answer}

\end{enumerate}
