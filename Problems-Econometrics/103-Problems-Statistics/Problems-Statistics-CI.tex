\item Does the $95\%$ confidence interval contain $\mu=5$? Explain.

\begin{answer}
The $p$-value is less than the significance level, so the null hypothesis is rejected,
\begin{align*}
p = 0.03 < 0.05 = \alpha = 1-0.95
\end{align*}
The confidence interval does not contain $\mu$.

\item Can you determine if $\mu=6$ is contained in the $95\%$ confidence interval? Explain.

\begin{answer}
There is not enough information to determine if $\mu=6$ is contained in the confidence interval. We know neither the sample size $n$ nor the variance $\sigma^2$. The variance could be estimated, but that estimate would depend on the sample size, which is unknown.

% UNFINISHED MUSINGS BELOW

What if we knew the sample size $n$? Oh and let's keep it simple and suppose we also know the variance $\sigma^2$ (an innocuous assumption for large $n$). Let's suppose $n=100$ and $\sigma^2=1$, so that $\sqrt{n}=10$. The significance level is $\alpha=1-0.95=0.05$ and we have $\mu_0=5$ and $p=0.03$.
A two-sided confidence interval under the null is the following:
\begin{align*}
H_0 \colon \mu = \mu_0, \quad H_1 \colon \mu \ne \mu_0\\
p = \P{-z_{\alpha/2}
    < \frac{\mean{Y}-\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} 
    < z_{\alpha/2} }
    & = 2\cdot\P{\frac{\mean{Y}-5}{1/\sqrt{100}} < 1.96}\\
0.03& = 2\cdot\P{\mean{Y} < 5.196}\\
% qnorm(1-0.03)
% 1.880794
\end{align*}
