\frametitle{Bias in a Telephone Survey}
In a given population, $11\%$ of the likely voters are African American. A survey using a simple random sample of $600$ landline telephone numbers finds $8\%$ African Americans. Is there evidence that the survey is biased? Explain.

\begin{answer}
The null hypothesis for a two-sided test is
\begin{align*}
H_0 \colon p = 0.11\\
H_1 \colon p \ne 0.11
\end{align*}
with sample size $n=600$. 
The $t$-statistic is
\begin{align*}
\hat{t}  
    = \frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\SE(\hat{p})}
  & = \frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n}}\\
  & = \frac{0.08-0.11}{0.08(1-0.08)/600}
   \approx \frac{-0.03}{0.011}
   \approx -2.709\\  
% se <- function(p,n)sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) 
% se(0.08, 600)
% 0.0110755
% (0.08-0.11)/se(0.08, 600)
% 2.708682
% se(0.11, 600)
% 0.01277367
% (0.08-0.11)/se(0.11, 600)
% -2.348581
\end{align*}
On the basis of this sample, the two-sided null hypothesis can be rejected at the $0.01$ significance level. 
\end{answer}
