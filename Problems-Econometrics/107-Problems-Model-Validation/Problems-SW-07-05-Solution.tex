The regression shown in column (2) was estimated again, this time using data from 1992 (4000 observations selected at random from the March 1993 Current Population Survey, converted into 2015 dollars using the Consumer Price Index). The results are
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{AHE}} 
  & = -\muse{1.3}{1.65} 
    + \muse{8.94}{0.34} \vn{College} 
    - \muse{4.38}{0.30} \vn{Female} 
    + \muse{0.67}{0.05} \vn{Age},\\
    \quad \bar{R}^2 
  & = 0.21,
    \quad \vn{SER} = 9.88
\end{align*}
Comparing this regression to the regression for 2015 shown in column (2), was there a statistically significant change in the coefficient on College?

Comparing this regression to the regression for 2015 shown in column (2), was there a statistically significant change in the coefficient on College?
\begin{answer}
The $t$-statistic for the difference in the college coefficients is:
\begin{align*}
t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 2015}}-\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 1992}}}{\SE(\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 2015}}-\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 1992}})}
\end{align*}
Since the samples are independent,
\begin{align*}
\cov(\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 2015}},\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 1992}}) = 0\\
\implies
\var(\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 2015}}-\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 1992}})
  & = \var(\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 2015}})
  + \var(\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 1992}})\\
  & = (0.29)^{2} + (0.34)^{2}\\
  & = 0.1997
% 0.29^2 + 0.34^2
% 0.1997
% sqrt(0.29^2 + 0.34^2)
% 0.4468781
\end{align*}
\end{answer}

Comparing this regression to the regression for 2015 shown in column (2), was there a statistically significant change in the coefficient on College?
\begin{answer}
The standard error is the square-root of the variance of the difference:
\begin{align*}
\SE(\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 2015}}-\hat{\beta}_{\text{College, 1992}})
  = \sqrt{0.1997}
  \approx 0.447
\end{align*}
The associated $t$-statistic is:
\begin{align*}
t = \frac{10.44-8.94}{\sqrt{0.1997}}
  \approx 
  \frac{1.5}{0.447}
  \approx 3.36 > 1.96
% (10.44-8.94)/sqrt(0.1997)
% 3.35662
\end{align*} 
Since the test statistic is greater than $1.96$, the hypothesis that there was no change in the population coefficient on $\vn{College}$ can be rejected at the $5\%$ level --- there was a statistically significant change in the coefficient between 1992 and 2015.
\end{answer}
