Using the regression results in column (2):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is age an important determinant of earnings? Use an appropriate statistical test and/or confidence interval to explain your answer.
\item Sally is a $29$-year-old female college graduate. Betsy is a $34$-year-old female college graduate. Construct a $95\%$ confidence interval for the expected difference between their earnings.

Using the regression results in column (2):

\item Is age an important determinant of earnings? Use an appropriate statistical test and/or confidence interval to explain your answer.

\begin{answer}
The $t$-statistic is $0.61/0.05=12.2>1.96$, so the coefficient on $Age$ is statistically significant at the $5\%$ level. Age is therefore an important determinant of earnings. A $95\%$ confidence interval for the population coefficient on $Age$ is:
\begin{align*}
[0.61 \pm 1.96 \times 0.05] = [0.512, 0.708]
\end{align*}
\end{answer}

\end{enumerate}

Using the regression results in column (2):

\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\item Sally is a $29$-year-old female college graduate. Betsy is a $34$-year-old female college graduate. Construct a $95\%$ confidence interval for the expected difference between their earnings.

\begin{answer}
The age difference is $\Delta Age = 34-29 = 5$ years, and so the expected difference between mean earnings for an age difference of $5$ years is:
\begin{align*}
\Delta Age \times [0.61 \pm 1.96 \times 0.05]
& = 5 \times [0.512, 0.708] \\
& = [2.56, 3.54]
\end{align*}
% 0.61 - 1.96 * 0.05
%  0.512
% 0.61 + 1.96 * 0.05
% 0.708
\end{answer}
