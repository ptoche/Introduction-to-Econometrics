\frametitle{Ridge Regression for School Test Scores}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fit a predictive model for school test scores using $817$ predictors with $1,966$ observations.
\item The square root of the MSPE estimates the magnitude of a typical out-of-sample prediction error. 
\item The choice of $m=10$ represents a practical balance between the desire to use as many observations as possible to estimate the parameters and the computational burden of repeating that estimation $m$ times for each value of $\lambda_{\text{Ridge}}$.
\item The MSPE is minimized for $\hat{\lambda}_{\text{Ridge}}=2,233$.
\item The square-root of MSPE evaluated at $\lambda_{\text{Ridge}}=\hat{\lambda}_{\text{Ridge}}$ is about $39.5$. 
\item The square-root of MSPE evaluated at $\lambda_{\text{Ridge}}=0$ --- the OLS estimator ---  is about $78.2$.
\item Because $\hat{\lambda}_{\text{Ridge}}$ minimizes the cross-validated MSPE, the cross-validated MSPE evaluated at $\hat{\lambda}_{\text{Ridge}}$ is not an unbiased estimator of the MSPE. We therefore use the remaining $1,966$ observations to obtain an unbiased estimator of the MSPE for ridge regression using $\hat{\lambda}_{\text{Ridge}}$.
