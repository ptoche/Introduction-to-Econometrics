\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many decisions in business and economics require quantitative estimates of how a change in one variable affects another variable.
\item The ideal way to estimate a causal effect is a randomized controlled experiment, but performing experiments in economic applications can be unethical, impractical, or too expensive.
\item Econometrics provides tools for estimating causal effects using observational data and exploiting accidental quasi-experiments.
\item Econometrics also provides tools for predicting the value of a variable of interest using information contained in other, related variables.
\item \emph{Cross-sectional data:} generated by observing multiple units at a single point in time. 
\item \emph{Time series data:} generated by observing a single unit at multiple points in time. 
\item \emph{Panel data:} generated by observing multiple units at multiple points in time.
