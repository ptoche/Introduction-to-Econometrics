\begin{itemize}
\item Economic theory is built around models designed to capture relationships among variables of interest.
\item Economic relationships can be complex. Models are imperfect and leave out important factors. Relevant variables may not be observable or may be mismeasured. Theories may miss out relevant variables or may misrepresent the nature of the interactions among variables. 
\item Theories are progressively refined as economists learn more about the phenomenon, but imperfect they will remain. Many of these imperfections in modeling and measurement are unpredictable --- if they were predictable, a model could be designed to explain them!
\item Econometric models assume some degree of randomness in the relationship --- even if the underlying economic model is deterministic. 
\item Stochastic processes are used to capture random departures from economic theory --- These departures are caused by errors in measurement, errors made by economic actors, errors caused by imperfect theories.
