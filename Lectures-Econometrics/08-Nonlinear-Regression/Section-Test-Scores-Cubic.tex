\emph{Cubic regression model:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Estimate of cubic regression model relating test scores and income:
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{TestScore}} 
  = \muse{600.1}{5.1} & + \muse{5.02}{0.71}\,Income - \muse{0.096}{0.029}\,Income^2\\
                     & + \muse{0.00069}{0.00035}\,Income^3, \quad \bar{R}^2 = 0.555
\end{align*}
\item Test $H_{0}\colon\beta_{3}=0, \quad H_{1}\colon\beta_{3}\ne0$
\begin{align*}
t^{\text{act}} 
  = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{3}-0}{\SE(\hat{\beta}_{3})}
  = \frac{0.00069}{0.00035}
  \approx 1.97
% 0.00069/0.00035
% 1.971429
\end{align*}
\item Since $t^{\text{act}}>1.96$, we can reject the null hypothesis at the $5\%$ level --- barely. 
\end{itemize}
