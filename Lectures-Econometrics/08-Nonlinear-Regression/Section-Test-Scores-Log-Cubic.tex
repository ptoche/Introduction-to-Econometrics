\emph{Linear-Log-Polynomial regression model:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Estimate of linear-log-polynomial regression model relating test scores and income:
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{TestScore}} 
  = \muse{486.1}{79.4} & + \muse{113.4}{87.9}\,\ln(Income) 
                         - \muse{26.9}{31.7}\,[\ln(Income)]^2\\
                       & - \muse{3.06}{3.74}\,[\ln(Income)]^3, \quad \bar{R}^2 = 0.560
\end{align*}
\item The null hypothesis that the true coefficient on the cubic term is zero cannot be rejected at the $10\%$ significance level. 
\item The $F$-statistic for the joint hypothesis that the true coefficients on the quadratic and cubic terms are both zero cannot be rejected at the $10\%$ level. 
\item The cubic logarithmic model is not, statistically speaking, an improvement over the linear-log model.
