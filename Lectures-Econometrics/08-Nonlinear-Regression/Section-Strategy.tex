\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Constant slope:}
\newlinequad 
The effect on $Y$ of a unit change in $X$ is the same for all values of the regressors. 
\item In the linear regression model, the population regression function has a constant slope. 
\item \emph{Non-constant slope:}
\newlinequad 
If the effect on $Y$ of a change in $X$ in fact depends on the value of one or more of the regressors, the population regression function is nonlinear.
