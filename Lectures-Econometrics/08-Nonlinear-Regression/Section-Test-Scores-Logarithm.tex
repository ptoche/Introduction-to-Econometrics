\emph{Linear-Log regression model:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Estimate of linear-log regression model relating test scores and income:
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{TestScore}} 
  = \muse{557.8}{3.8} & + \muse{36.42}{1.40}\,\ln(Income), \quad \bar{R}^2 = 0.561
\end{align*}
\item A $1\%$ increase in income causes an increase in test scores of $0.01\times36.42=0.36$ points.
\item Predicted difference in test scores for districts with average incomes of $\$10,000$ vs $\$11,000$:
\begin{align*}
\Delta\hat{Y} 
  & = [557.8 + 36.42 \ln(11)] - [557.8 + 36.42 \ln(10)]\\
  & = 36.42[\ln(11)-\ln(10)]
    \approx 3.47
\end{align*}
\item Predicted difference in test scores for districts with average incomes of $\$40,000$ vs $\$41,000$:
\begin{align*}
\Delta\hat{Y} 
  & = 36.42[\ln(41)-\ln(40)]
    \approx 0.90
\end{align*}
\item A $\$1000$ increase in income has a larger effect on test scores in poor districts than it does in affluent districts.

\emph{Log-Linear vs. Log-Log regression model:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Estimate of log-linear regression model relating test scores and income:
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\ln(\vn{TestScore})} 
  = \muse{6.439}{0.003} & + \muse{0.00284}{0.00018}\,Income, \quad \bar{R}^2 = 0.497
\end{align*}
\item A $1$ dollar increase in income is associated with an increase in test scores of $100\times0.00284=0.284$ percent.
\item Estimate of log-log regression model relating test scores and income:
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\ln(\vn{TestScore})} 
  = \muse{6.336}{0.006} & + \muse{0.0554}{0.0021}\,\ln(Income), \quad \bar{R}^2 = 0.557
\end{align*}
\item A $1\%$ increase in income is associated with an increase in test scores of $0.0554$ percent.
\item The log-log model appears to be a better fit than the log-linear model. But unfortunately the $\bar{R}^{2}$ cannot be used to compare the models, because they use different dependent variables.
