\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item In a nonlinear regression, the slope of the population regression function depends on the value of one or more of the independent variables.
\item The effect on $Y$ of a change in the independent variables can be computed by evaluating the regression function at two values of the independent variables. 
\item A polynomial regression includes powers of $X$ as regressors. A quadratic regression includes $X$ and $X^{2}$, and a cubic regression includes $X$, $X^{2}$, and $X^{3}$.
\item Small changes in logarithms can be interpreted as proportional or percentage changes in a variable. Regressions involving logarithms are used to estimate proportional changes and elasticities.
\item The product of two variables is called an interaction term. When interaction terms are included as regressors, they allow the regression slope of one variable to depend on the value of another variable.
