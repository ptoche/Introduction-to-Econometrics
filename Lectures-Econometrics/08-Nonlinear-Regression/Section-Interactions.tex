\item \emph{Interaction between two binary variables:} 
\begin{align*}
Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} D_{1i} + \beta_{2} D_{2i} + \beta_{3}\, D_{1i} \cdot D_{2i} + u_{i}
\end{align*}
where $D_{1i} \cdot D_{2i}$ is called an interaction term.
\item \emph{Interpretation:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the expected values of $Y$ for each possible case described by the binary variables. 
\item Compare the expected values in each case. 
\item Each coefficient can be expressed either as an expected value or as the difference between two or more expected values.

\item \emph{Interaction between a continuous and a binary variable:} 
\begin{align*}
Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{i} + \beta_{2} D_{i} + \beta_{3}\, X_{i} \cdot D_{i} + u_{i}
\end{align*}
\item \emph{Interpretation:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $D_{i}=0$, the population regression function is $\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{i}$. 
\item If $D_{i}=1$, the population regression function is $(\beta_{0}+\beta_{2}) + (\beta_{1}+\beta_{3}) X_{i}$. 
\item The difference between the two intercepts is $\beta_{2}$. 
\item The difference between the two slopes is $\beta_{3}$.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Interaction between two continuous variables:} 
\begin{align*}
Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1i} + \beta_{2} X_{2i} + \beta_{3}\, X_{1i} \cdot X_{2i} + u_{i}
\end{align*}
\item \emph{Interpretation:} The interaction term
\begin{enumerate}
\item allows the effect of a change in $X_{1}$ to depend on $X_{2}$.
\item allows the effect of a change in $X_{2}$ to depend on the value of $X_{1}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item The coefficient on $X_{1} \cdot X_{2}$ is the effect of a one-unit increase in $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, beyond the sum of the individual effects of a unit increase in $X_{1}$ alone and a unit increase in $X_{2}$ alone.
\item The effect on $Y$ of a change in $X_{1}$, holding $X_{2}$ constant, is
\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X_{1}} = \beta_{1} + \beta_{3}\, X_{2}
\end{align*}
and likewise for $\Delta X_{2}$.
If $X_{1}$ changes by $\Delta X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ changes by $\Delta X_{2}$, then the expected change in $Y$ is:
\begin{align*}
\Delta Y = (\beta_{1} + \beta_{3}\, X_{2}) \Delta X_{1} 
         + (\beta_{2} + \beta_{3}\, X_{1}) \Delta X_{2} 
         + \beta_{3} \Delta X_{1} \Delta X_{2} 
\end{align*}
