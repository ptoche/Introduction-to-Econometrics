  \frametitle{Example: Mincer's (1974) wage regression}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Economic Model: wage depends on human capital
    \begin{align*}
    \mathrm{wage} &= f \left(\mathrm{educ}, \mathrm{exper},\mathrm{training}
    \right) 
     \end{align*}
  \item Econometric Model: 
    \begin{align*}
    \log(\mathrm{wage}) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathrm{educ} + \beta_2 \mathrm{exper}
    + \beta_3 (\mathrm{exper})^2 + \beta_4 \mathrm{training} +u 
     \end{align*}
    The term u captures unobserved factors:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item innate ability, 
    \item family background, 
    \item  quality of education
    \end{itemize}
  \item Hypothesis Testing: whether training affects wage $H_0 : \beta_4 = 0$
  \end{itemize}
