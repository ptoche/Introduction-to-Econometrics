\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Population Parameter}: a measure of the population
\item mean household income for all U.S. households; proportion of all American voters approving president's performance;
\item \emph{Sample:} is part of, a subset, of the population
\item \emph{Estimator (or Statistic)}: a formula or procedure used to estimate the value of the population parameter using a sample of the population
\item e.g., formula to calculate sample mean (\(\bar{Y}\)) or sample
proportion (\(\hat{p}\))
\item \emph{Point Estimate}: numeric value generated from calculating an
estimator from a specific sample of data
e.g., sample mean household income is \$81,000, 2017 American
Community Survey

\frametitle{Notation for Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item Population Parameters: Denoted by Greek setters, usually lowercase
\item \(\mu\) : ``mu'' refers to population mean
\item \(\sigma\): ``sigma'' refers to population standard deviation
\item \(\beta\): ``beta'' refers to population regression coefficient
\item Subscripts usually denote population parameters of certain variables
\item \(\mu_Y\) : ``mu Y'' refers to population mean of the variable Y
\item \(\sigma_X\): ``sigma X'' refers to population standard deviation of
\item Estimators of Population Parameters (two general approaches)
\begin{itemize}
\item Denoted using Greek letters with a ``hat''
\item \(\hat{\mu}_Y\) : ``mu Y hat'' refers to the estimate of \(\mu_Y\)
\item \(\hat{\beta}_X\): ``beta X hat'' refers to the estimate of
\(\beta_X\)
\end{itemize}
\item Denoted using English/Arabic letters
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\bar{Y}\): ``Y bar'' refers to the estimate of \(\mu_Y\)
\item \(s_X\): ``S of X'' refers to the estimate of \(\sigma_X\)
\end{itemize}
