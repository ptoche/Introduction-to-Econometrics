\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Chi-Square Distribution:} Distribution of the sum of $m$ squared independent standard normal random variables. This distribution is parameterized by the ``degrees of freedom'' $m$.
\item Named after the Greek letter ``chi'' $\chi$.
\item Let $Z_1$, $Z_2$, $Z_3$ be independent standard normal random variables. Then $Z_1^2+Z_2^2+Z_3^2$ has a chi-squared distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. 
\begin{align*}
Z_1, Z_2, Z_3 \sim iid ~ N(0,1)
\implies 
Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + Z_3^2 \sim \chi^2_3
\end{align*}
\item The $95$th percentile of the $\chi^2_3$ distribution is $7.81$, so 
\begin{align*}
\Pr(Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + Z_3^2 \leq 7.81) = 0.95
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
