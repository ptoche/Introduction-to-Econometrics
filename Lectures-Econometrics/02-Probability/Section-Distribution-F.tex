\frametitle{Fisher's F Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{F Distribution:} The distribution of the ratio of two independently distributed chi-squared random variables. Used to conduct F-tests, particularly in the context of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and when comparing the fits of different linear regression models, e.g. Chow test. 
\item Named after Statistician Ronald Aylmer Fisher.
\item Let $V$ be a chi-squared random variable with $n$ degrees of freedom, let $W$ be a chi-squared random variable with $m$ degrees of freedom, with $V$ and $W$ independently distributed, then
\begin{align*}
W \sim \chi^2 (m), 
\quad
V \sim \chi^2 (n),
\quad
W \indep V
\implies
F = \frac{W/m}{V/n} \sim F(m, n)
\end{align*}
\item Special case:
\begin{align*}
F(m, n\to\infty) \to  \chi^2(m)
\end{align*}
\item The $95$th percentile of the $F(3,30)$ distribution is $2.92$; The $95$th percentile of the $F(3,90)$ distribution is $2.71$. In the limit, as $n\to\infty$, the $95$th percentile tends to $2.60$.
