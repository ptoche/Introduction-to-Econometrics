\begin{enumerate}
\item Guinevere has two children, one of them a girl. What is the probability that the other child is also a girl?
\item You flip a fair coin $10$ times. Use the definition of the mathematical expectation for a discrete distribution to calculate the expected number of heads. 
\item You flip a biased coin $10$ times. The probability of head is $0.9$ on a single flip. Calculate the expected number of heads.
\item You roll a die until a six comes up. What is the expected number of rolls?
\item You choose an integer $X$ at random between $1$ and $10$. Then you choose an integer $Y$ at random between $1$ and $X=x$. Calculate the expected value of $Y$. 
\item Six numbers are randomly selected from the discrete set $\{1,2,\ldots,100\}$. You bet $\$1$ to draw exactly six given numbers. What is the expected value of the bet if the prize is $1$ million? For what prize value does the bet ``break even''? (In other words, What prize value gives an expectation of $\$1$, so that you are just as likely to profit as you are to lose)
