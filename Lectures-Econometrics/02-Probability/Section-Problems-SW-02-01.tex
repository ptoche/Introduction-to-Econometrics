\exercise{Stock \& Watson, Introduction (4th), Chapter~2, Exercise~1.}
Let $Y$ denote the number of ``heads'' that occur when two coins are tossed.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the probability distribution of Y.
\item Derive the cumulative probability distribution of Y.
\item Derive the mean and variance of Y.
\end{enumerate}

\exercise{Reading Probability tables AND writing code, compute the following:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $Y \sim N(1,4)$, compute $\Pr(Y \leq 3)$.
\item If $Y \sim N(50,25)$, compute $\Pr(40 \leq Y \leq 52)$.
\item If $Y \sim \chi^2_{10}$, compute $\Pr(Y > 18.31)$.
\item If $Y \sim t_{15}$, compute $\Pr(Y > 1.75)$.
\item If $Y \sim F_{7,4}$, compute $\Pr(Y > 2.79)$.
\item If $\mu_Y=100$ and $\sigma_Y^2=43$, use the central limit theorem to compute $\Pr(101 \leq Y \leq 103)$ for a random sample of size $n=64$.
