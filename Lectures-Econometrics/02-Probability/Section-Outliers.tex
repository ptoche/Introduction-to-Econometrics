\frametitle{Outliers}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Outlier:} 
A data point that differs significantly from other observations.
\item Outliers are expected to occur in random data, but distributions differ in how frequently outliers are observed and how far they lie from the center of the distribution.
\item The probability of an outlier drawn from a normal distribution is small --- not zero, but small.
\item \emph{Stock Market Crash:} On ``Black Monday'' (October 19, 1987), the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell $22.6\%$. By comparison, the standard deviation of daily percentage price changes on the DJIA had been about one-percent over the previous twenty years! 
\item A drop of $22.6\%$ was a negative return of $21$ standard deviations $22.6/1.08$. If daily percentage price changes were normally distributed, then the probability of a change of at least $21$ standard deviations would be
\begin{align*}
\Pr(|Z| \geq 21) = 2 \Phi(-21) \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-98}
\end{align*}
\item Stock price percentage changes have a distribution with heavier tails than the normal distribution!
