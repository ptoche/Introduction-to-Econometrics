\frametitle{Independence}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Independence:} Two random variables $X,Y$ are independent if
\begin{align*}
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y) ~\text{for all}~ x,y
\end{align*}
\item This definition holds for both discrete and continuous variables.
\item $X \indep Y$ implies
\begin{align*}
f_{X|Y}(x|y) = f_X(x)
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
