\frametitle{Variance}
\begin{itemize}
\item The expectation and variance are special cases of the ``moments'' of a random variable. The expectation is the first moment --- The variance is the second ``central'' moment. Moments of order $k$ are defined as follows:
\item \emph{$k$th moment} of $X$: 
\begin{align*}
\exp[X^k]
\end{align*}
\item \emph{$k$th central moment} of $X$: 
\begin{align*}
\exp\left[\left(X - \exp[X]\right)^k\right]
\end{align*}
\item \emph{Variance as Second Central Moment:}
\begin{align*}
\var(X) 
  & = \exp\left[ \left(X - \exp[X]\right)^2 \right]\\
  & = \exp[X^2] - 2\exp[X\cdot\exp[X]] +\exp(\exp[X])^2\\
  & = \exp[X^2] - \exp[X]^2
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Standard Deviation}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Standard deviation:}
\begin{emphalign*}
\std(X) = \sqrt{\var(X)}
\end{emphalign*}
\item The standard deviation is expressed in the same units as the expected value, whereas the variance is expressed in squared-units, which may not be so easily interpreted.
\item While the expectation operator is linear, the variance is quadratic in the following sense:
\begin{align*}
\var(a + b X) = b^2 \var(X)
\end{align*}
\item The standard deviation satisfies:
\begin{align*}
\std(a + b X) = b \std(X)
\end{align*}
This is not the same as ``linearity'' since the constant term $a$ has vanished.
\end{itemize}
