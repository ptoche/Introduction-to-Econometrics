\item \emph{Expectation of Discrete Random Variable:}
\begin{emphalign*}
\exp[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \, f_X(x_i)
\end{emphalign*}
\item \emph{Expectation of Continuous Random Variable:}
\begin{emphalign*}
\exp[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f_X(x) \,dx
\end{emphalign*}
\item The expectation of a random variable is also known as ``expected value'', ``first moment,'' and more casually as ``average.''

\item \emph{Properties of Expectations:}
\item The expectation operator is linear:
\begin{align*}
\exp[a X + b Y] = a \exp[X] + b \exp[Y]
\end{align*}
\item The expectation of a composition is:
\begin{align*}
\exp[g(X)] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x) f_X(x) dx
\end{align*}
for some real-valued function $g$ with appropriate support.
