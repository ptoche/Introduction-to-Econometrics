\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Joint Probability:} Probability of event $A$ and event $B$ occurring together,
\begin{align*}
\Pr(A \cap B) =  \Pr(A | B) \cdot \Pr(B)
\end{align*}
\item \emph{Conditional Probability:} Probability of event $A$ given that event $B$ has occurred, 
\begin{align*}
\Pr(A | B) = \Pr(A \cap B) / \Pr(B)
\end{align*}
\item \emph{Marginal Probability:} Unconditional Probability of event $A$ irrespective of whether event $B$ has occurred or not --- ``an absolute'' determined in the universe.
\item $A$ is \emph{independent} of $B$ iff 
\begin{align*}
\Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B)
\end{align*}
\item $A$ \emph{independent} of $B$ is sometimes denoted $A \indep B$.
\item $A \indep B$ implies
\begin{align*}
\Pr(A | B) = \Pr(A) ~\text{and}~ \Pr(B | A) = \Pr(B)
\end{align*}
\item If $A$ and $B$ are independent, knowing whether $B$ occurred carries no information about $A$.
