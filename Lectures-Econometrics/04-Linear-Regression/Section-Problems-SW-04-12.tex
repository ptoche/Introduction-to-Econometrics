\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the regression $R^2$ in the regression of $Y$ on $X$ is the squared value of the sample correlation between $X$ and $Y$. That is, show that $R^2=r^2_{XY}$.
\item Show that the $R^2$ from the regression of $Y$ on $X$ is the same as the $R^2$ from the regression of $X$ on $Y$.
\item Show that $\hat{\beta}_1=r_{XY}(s_{Y}/s_{X})$, where $r_{XY}$ is the sample correlation between $X$ and $Y$, and $s_X$ and $s_Y$ are the sample standard deviations of $X$ and $Y$.
