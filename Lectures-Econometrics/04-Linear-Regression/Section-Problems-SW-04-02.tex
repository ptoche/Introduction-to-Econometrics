Suppose a random sample of $200$ $20$-year-old men is selected from a population and their heights and weights are recorded. A regression of weight on height yields:
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{Weight}} 
  = -99.41 + 3.94 \times \vn{Height},
  \quad R^2 = 0.81,
  \quad \vn{SER} = 10.2
\end{align*}
where $\vn{Weight}$ is measured in pounds and $\vn{Height}$ is measured in inches. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the regression's weight prediction for someone who is $70$ in. tall? $65$ in. tall? $74$ in. tall?
\item A man has a late growth spurt and grows $1.5$ in. over the course of a year. What is the regression's prediction for the increase in this man's weight?
\item Suppose that instead of measuring weight and height in pounds and inches, these variables are measured in centimeters and kilograms. What are the regression estimates from this new kilogram-centimeter regression? (Give all results, estimated coefficients, $R^{2}$, and $\vn{SER}$.)
\end{enumerate}
