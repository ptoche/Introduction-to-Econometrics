A researcher, using data on class size (CS) and average test scores from $100$ third-grade classes, estimates the OLS regression:
\begin{align*}\vspace*{-2ex}
\verywidehat{\vn{TestScore}} 
  = 520.4 - 5.82 \times CS,
  \quad R^2 = 0.08,
  \quad \vn{SER} = 11.5
\end{align*}
\vspace*{-2ex}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A classroom has $22$ students. What is the regression's prediction for that classroom's average test score?
\item Last year a classroom had $19$ students, and this year it has $23$ students. What is the regression's prediction for the change in the classroom average test score?
\item The sample average class size across the $100$ classrooms is $21.4$. What is the sample average of the test scores across the $100$ classrooms?
\item What is the sample standard deviation of test scores across the $100$ classrooms?
\end{enumerate}
