\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{The sum of squared residuals is minimized:}
\begin{align*}
\hat{u}_{i} = Y_{i} - \hat{Y}_{i}, \qquad
\sum\nolimits_{i}\hat{u}_{i}^{2} \to \min
\end{align*}
The residuals are the prediction errors of the estimates. 
\item \emph{The mean residuals are zero:}
\begin{align*}
\tfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{u}_{i} = 0
\end{align*}
\item \emph{The residuals are uncorrelated with the predictor:}
\begin{align*}
\cov(X_{i}, \hat{u}_{i}) = 0
\end{align*}
\item \emph{The residuals are uncorrelated with the fitted values:}
\begin{align*}
\cov(\hat{Y}_{i}, \hat{u}_{i}) = 0
\end{align*}
