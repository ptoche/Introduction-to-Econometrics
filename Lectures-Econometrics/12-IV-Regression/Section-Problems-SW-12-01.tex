This question refers to the panel data IV regressions summarized in Table 12.1.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose the federal government is considering a new tax on cigarettes that is estimated to increase the retail price by $\$0.50$ per pack. If the current price per pack is $\$7.50$, use the IV regression in column (1) to predict the change in demand. Construct a $95\%$ confidence interval for the change in demand.
\item Suppose the United States enters a recession and income falls by $2\%$. Use the IV regression in column (1) to predict the change in demand.
\item Suppose the recession lasts less than one year. Do you think that the IV regression in column (1) will provide a reliable answer to the question in (b)? Why or why not?
\item Suppose the $F$-statistic in column (1) were $3.7$ instead of $33.7$. Would the IV regression provide a reliable answer to the question posed in (a)? Why or why not?
\end{enumerate}
