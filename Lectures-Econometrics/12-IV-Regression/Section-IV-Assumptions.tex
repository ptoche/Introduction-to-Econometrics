\frametitle{IV Regression Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{The variables satisfy:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\exp[u_{i}|W_{1i},\ldots,W_{ri}]=0$
\item $(X_{1i},\ldots,X_{ki},W_{1i},\ldots,W_{ri},Z_{1i},\ldots,Z_{mi},Y_{i})$ are i.i.d. draws from their joint distribution
\item $X$, $W$, $Z$, and $Y$ have non-zero finite fourth moments (outliers unlikely)
\item The instruments are valid, in that they satisfy:
\begin{itemize}
\item[--] Instrument relevance.
\item[--] Instrument exogeneity.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{Estimator:} 
\newlinequad
The TSLS estimator is consistent and normally distributed in large samples. 
\item \emph{Inference:} 
\newlinequad
Valid, including hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. 
\item \emph{Standard errors:}
\newlinequad
Second-stage regression standard errors are incorrect! Correct standard errors are provided by specialized packages ---
always use heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.
\end{itemize}
