\frametitle{Two Conditions for Valid Instruments}
\emph{The TSLS estimator is consistent and has a normal sampling distribution in large samples IF:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Instrument Relevance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $\hat{X}_{1i}$ be the predicted value from the regression of $X_{1i}$ on the instruments ($Z$) and the included exogenous regressors ($W$): 
\begin{align*}
\hat{X}_{1i},\ldots,\hat{X}_{ki},W_{1i},\ldots,W_{ri},1 ~\text{are not perfectly multicollinear.}
\end{align*}
($1$ is the intercept). 
\end{itemize}
\item \emph{Instrument Exogeneity}
\begin{itemize}
\item The instruments are uncorrelated with the error term: 
\begin{align*}
\cor(Z_{1i},u_{i}) = \ldots = \cor(Z_{mi},u_{i}) = 0.
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
