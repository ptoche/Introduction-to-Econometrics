\emph{Test the Hypothesis $\beta_{j}=\beta_{j,0}$}
\begin{enumerate}
\item State the Null Hypothesis and the Alternate:
\begin{align*}
H_{0}\colon \beta_{j}=\beta_{j,0}; 
\qquad 
H_{1}\colon \beta_{j}\ne\beta_{j,0}
\end{align*}
%\item Compute the standard error: \quad $\SE(\hat{\beta}_{j})$
\item Compute the $t$-statistic: \quad $t^{\text{act}}=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{j}-\beta_{j,0}}{\SE(\hat{\beta}_{j})}$
\item Compute the $p$-value: \quad $p=2\Phi(-\abs{t^{\text{act}}})$
\item Conclude: \quad $p<\alpha \implies$ reject $H_{0}$ \quad (fail to reject otherwise).

\item Compute the $p$-value: 
\quad $p=2\Phi(-2.54)\approx 1.1\%$.
\item Reject $H_{0}$ at the $5\%$ level.
\item $95\%$ Confidence interval:
\quad $-1.10 \pm 1.96 \cdot 0.43 \approx (-1.95, -0.26)$.

\emph{Test the Hypothesis $\vn{STR}=0$}
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{TestScore}}
  = \muse{649.6}{15.5} - \muse{0.29}{0.48}   \vn{STR}

                       + \muse{3.87}{1.59}   \vn{Expn}
\end{align*}
where $\vn{Expn}$ is total annual expenditures per pupil in thousands of dollars.
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding $\vn{Expn}$ as a regressor, the estimated coefficient on $\vn{STR}$ changes from $-1.10$ to $-0.29$. 
\item The $t$-statistic associated with $H_{0}\colon \vn{STR}=0$ is $t^{\text{act}}=\frac{-0.29-0}{0.48}\approx-0.60$. \item $H_{0}$ cannot be rejected at the $10\%$ significance level.
\item Holding expenditures per pupil and the percentage of English learners constant, the student-teacher ratio has no significant effect on test scores. 
\item Interpretation: school administrators allocate their budgets efficiently.
\item In other words: Reallocating spending to reduce class sizes --- without increasing spending --- will not help raise test scores. There is no ``free lunch''.
