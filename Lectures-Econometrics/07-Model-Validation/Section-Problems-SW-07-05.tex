The regression shown in column (2) was estimated again, this time using data from 1992 (4000 observations selected at random from the March 1993 Current Population Survey, converted into 2015 dollars using the Consumer Price Index). The results are
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{AHE}} 
  & = -\muse{1.3}{1.65} 
    + \muse{8.94}{0.34} \vn{College} 
    - \muse{4.38}{0.30} \vn{Female} 
    + \muse{0.67}{0.05} \vn{Age},\\
    \quad \bar{R}^2 
  & = 0.21,
    \quad \vn{SER} = 9.88
\end{align*}
Comparing this regression to the regression for 2015 shown in column (2), was there a statistically significant change in the coefficient on College?
