\emph{$F$-Test for Two Restrictions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The F-statistic is used to test a joint hypothesis about regression coefficients. 
\item Joint Hypothesis:
\quad $H_{0}\colon \beta_{1}=0 \quad \text{and} \quad \beta_{2}=0$
\item $F$-statistic with $q=2$ restrictions:
\begin{align*}
F = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{t_{1}^{2}+t_{2}^{2}-2\hat{\rho}_{t_{1},t_{2}} t_{1}t_{2}}{1-\hat{\rho}_{t_{1},t_{2}}^{2}}\right)
\end{align*}
where $\hat{\rho}_{t_{1},t_{2}}$ is an estimator of the correlation between the two $t$-statistics.
\item In large samples, under the null hypothesis, the $F$-statistic has sampling distribution $F_{q,\infty}$.
\end{itemize}

\item Compute heteroskedasticity-robust $F$-statistic:
\quad $F^{\text{act}}=5.43$. 
\newlinequad
In large samples, $F \sim F(2,\infty)$.
\item Compute critical $F_{\alpha/2}(2,\infty)$ values:
\begin{align*}
F_{0.05/2}(2,\infty) & \approx 3.00 \\
F_{0.01/2}(2,\infty) & \approx 4.61 
\end{align*}
\item Conclude: 
\quad $F^{\text{act}}>F_{\alpha/2}(2,\infty)\implies$ reject $H_{0}$. 
\newline
At least one of $\vn{STR}$ or $\vn{Expn}$ has a statistically significant effect on $\vn{TestScore}$.
