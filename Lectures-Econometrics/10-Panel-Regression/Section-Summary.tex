\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Panel data consist of observations on multiple units --- households, countries --- where each entity is observed at two or more time periods.
\item Regression with fixed effects controls for unobserved variables that differ from one unit to the next but remain constant over time.
\item When there are two time periods, fixed effects regression can be estimated by a ``before and after'' regression of the change in $Y$ from the first period to the second on the corresponding change in $X$.
\item Time fixed effects control for unobserved variables that are the same across units but vary over time.
\item Standard errors need to allow both for serial correlation and for heteroskedasticity, and one way to do so is to use clustered standard errors.
\end{itemize}
