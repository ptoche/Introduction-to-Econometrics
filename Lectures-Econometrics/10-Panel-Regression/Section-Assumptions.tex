\emph{Assumptions for Causal Inference}
\begin{align*}
Y_{it} = \beta_{1} X_{it} + \alpha_{i} + u_{it}
\end{align*}
where $\beta_{1}$ is the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\exp[u_{it}|X_{i1},X_{i2},\ldots,X_{iT},\alpha_{i}]$: The conditional mean of errors is zero.
\item $X_{i1},X_{i2},\ldots,X_{iT},u_{i1},u_{i2},\ldots,u_{iT}$ are i.i.d. draws from the joint distribution.
\item $(X_{it}, u_{it})$ have non-zero finite fourth moments: outliers are unlikely.
\item No perfect multicollinearity. 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Autocorrelation:} 
\newline
If $X_{it}$ is correlated with $X_{is}$ for different values of $s$ and $t$, then $X_{it}$ is ``autocorrelated'' or ``serially correlated''. 
\item \emph{HAR standard errors:}
\newline
Heteroskedasticity-and Autocorrelation-Robust (HAR) standard errors:
\newlinequad
Standard errors that are valid if $u_{it}$ is (potentially or effectively) heteroskedastic and correlated over time within an entity. Example: \emph{clustered standard errors}.
\end{itemize}
