\emph{Eliminating Fixed Effects}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $Z_{i}$ be a variable that determines the fatality rate in the $i$th state but does not change over time: Note the absence of the time subscript in $Z_{i}$, meaning $Z_{i,1982}=Z_{i,1988}$.
\begin{align*}
\vn{FatalityRate_{i,1982}}
  & = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \vn{BeerTax}_{i,1982} + \beta_{2} Z_{i} + u_{i,1982}\\
\vn{FatalityRate_{i,1988}}
  & = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \vn{BeerTax}_{i,1988} + \beta_{2} Z_{i} + u_{i,1988}
\end{align*}
\item Because $Z_{i}$ does not change over time, it cannot be the cause of any change in the fatality rate between 1982 and 1988. 
\item \emph{The influence of $Z_{i}$ can be eliminated by analyzing the change in the fatality rate between the two periods.} Taking the difference between the above two equations:
\begin{align*}
& \vn{FatalityRate_{i,1988}} - \vn{FatalityRate_{i,1982}}\\
  & \quad = \left(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \vn{BeerTax}_{i,1988} + \beta_{2} Z_{i} + u_{i,1988}\right)
  - \left(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \vn{BeerTax}_{i,1982} + \beta_{2} Z_{i} + u_{i,1982}\right)\\[1ex]
  & \quad = \beta_{1}\, (\vn{BeerTax}_{i,1988}-\vn{BeerTax}_{i,1982})
    + u_{i,1988}-u_{i,1982}
\end{align*}
where the constants $\beta_{0}$ and $Z_{i}$ have been cancelled out of the difference.

\emph{Difference Operator $\Delta$}
\begin{itemize}
\item The difference operator, denoted $\Delta$, is a convenient device to compute a difference between two regression equations with less notation.
\item Let $\Delta X_{i}$ denote the difference operator:
\begin{align*}
\Delta X_{i} = X_{i,a}-X_{i,b} \quad\text{for some variable $X$ measured between dates $a$ and $b$.}
\end{align*}
\item Consider the regression equation in year $t$ (where $t$ stands for either date $a$ or date $b$):
\begin{align*}
Y_{i,t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{i,t} + \beta_{2} Z_{i} + u_{i,t}
\end{align*}
\item Apply the operator to the regression equation:
\begin{align*}
\Delta Y_{i} = \beta_{1} \Delta X_{i} + \Delta u_{i}
\end{align*}
(note that $\beta_{0}+\beta_{2}Z_{i}$ cancels out)
\item Thus, let $\Delta X_{i}$ denote the difference operator for years 1988 and 1982:
\begin{align*}
\Delta \vn{FatalityRate_{i}}
  = \beta_{1}\Delta\vn{BeerTax}_{i} + \Delta u_{i}
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Interpreting Before-and-After Effects} 
\begin{itemize}
\item If omitted variables such as ``cultural attitude'' or ``law and order'' did not change between 1982 and 1988, then they cannot be the cause of any observed change in fatalities in the state over that period.
\item After differencing, omitted variables that are constant cancel out of the regression equation: 
\emph{We do not need data for these omitted variables!}
\begin{align*}
\Delta\verywidehat{\vn{FatalityRate}_{i}}
  = -\muse{0.072}{0.065} 
  - \muse{1.04}{0.36} \Delta \vn{BeerTax}_{i}
\end{align*}
\item The estimated regression suggests that traffic fatalities can be cut in half merely by increasing the real tax on beer by $\$1$ per case.
\item This simple ``before-and-after'' analysis --- regression in differences --- would be cumbersome to extend to several time periods. Since our dataset contains seven years, we develop a more general approach: fixed effect regression.
\end{itemize}
