\emph{Internal and external validity}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Definition:}
Distinguish between the population and setting from which the sample was drawn and the population and setting to which the causal inferences from the study are to be applied. 
\emph{Internal validity:} The statistical inferences about causal effects are valid for the population under study. 
\emph{External validity:} The statistical inferences about causal effects can be generalized from the population and setting studied to other populations and settings.
\item \emph{Threats to external validity:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Differences in populations:}
The selected population may differ from the population of interest, e.g. geographical differences, individual differences.  
\item \emph{Differences in settings:}
The legal setting in which the study was conducted may differ from the legal setting to which its results are applied.
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{Threats to internal validity:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Omitted variable bias}
\item \emph{Functional form misspecification}
\item \emph{Errors-in-variables bias}
\item \emph{Sample selection}
\item \emph{Simultaneous causality}
\end{enumerate}
