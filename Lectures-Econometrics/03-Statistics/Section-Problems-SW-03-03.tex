In a survey of $400$ likely voters, $215$ responded that they would vote for the incumbent, and $185$ responded that they would vote for the challenger. Let $p$ denote the fraction of all likely voters who preferred the incumbent at the time of the survey, and let $\hat{p}$ be the fraction of survey respondents who preferred the incumbent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the survey results to estimate $p$.
\item Use the estimator of the variance of $\hat{p}$,~  $\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})$, to calculate the standard error of your estimator. 
\item What is the $p$-value for the test of $H_{0}{:}~ p=0.5$ ~vs.~ $H_{1}{:}~ p\neq 0.5$?
\item What is the $p$-value for the test of $H_{0}{:}~ p=0.5$ ~vs.~ $H_{1}{:}~ p > 0.5$?
\item Why do the results from (c) and (d) differ?
\item Did the survey contain statistically significant evidence that the incumbent was ahead of the challenger at the time of the survey? Explain.
\end{enumerate}
