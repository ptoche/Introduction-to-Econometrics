\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Test for Difference Between Two Means:} 
Consider the null that two groups $w$ and $m$ differ by a quantity $d_0$:
\begin{align*}
H_0\colon & \mu_m - \mu_w = d_0 \\
H_1\colon & \mu_m - \mu_w \ne d_0 
\end{align*}
\item Example: Test the hypothesis that the earnings of women and men are no different on average, that is $d_0=0$:
\begin{align*}
H_0\colon & \mu_{\text{men}} = \mu_{\text{women}} \\
H_1\colon & \mu_{\text{men}} \ne \mu_{\text{women}}
\end{align*}
\item To test the hypothesis, we collect two samples of size $n_w$ and $n_m$ and compute the \text{actual} sample means $\mean{Y}_w$ and $\mean{Y}_m$. A natural estimator for this test is $\mean{Y}_m-\mean{Y}_w$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the sample distribution of the estimator $\mean{Y}_m-\mean{Y}_w$~?
\item We have
\begin{align*}
\mean{Y}_w \sim N(\mu_w, \sigma_w^2/n_w), \quad
\mean{Y}_m \sim N(\mu_m, \sigma_m^2/n_m), \quad
\mean{Y}_m \indep \mean{Y}_w
\end{align*}
\item The distribution follows:
\begin{align*}
\mean{Y}_m-\mean{Y}_w \sim N\left(\mu_m-\mu_w, \frac{\sigma_m^2}{n_m} + \frac{\sigma_w^2}{n_w} \right)
\end{align*}
\item The standard error:
\begin{align*}
\SE(\mean{Y}_m-\mean{Y}_w) 
  = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_m^2}{n_m} + \frac{\sigma_w^2}{n_w}}
\end{align*}
\item The $t$-statistic for comparing two means:
\begin{align*}
t = \frac{(\mean{Y}_m-\mean{Y}_w) - d_0}{\SE(\mean{Y}_m-\mean{Y}_w)}
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
