In a population, $\mu_{Y}=100$ and $\sigma^2_{Y}=43$. Use the central limit theorem to answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In a random sample of size $n=100$,\, find $\text{Pr}(\mean{Y}<101)$.
\item In a random sample of size $n=64$,\, find $\text{Pr}(101<\mean{Y}<103)$.
\item In a random sample of size $n=165$,\, find $\text{Pr}(\mean{Y}>98)$.
\end{enumerate}

Let $Y$ be a Bernoulli random variable with success probability $\Pr(Y=1)=p$, and let $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n$ be i.i.d. draws from this distribution. Let $\hat{p}$ be the fraction of successes ($1$s) in this sample.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $\hat{p} = \mean{Y}$.
\item Show that $\hat{p}$ is an unbiased estimator of $p$.
\item Show that $\var(\hat{p})=p(1-p)/n$.
\end{enumerate}
