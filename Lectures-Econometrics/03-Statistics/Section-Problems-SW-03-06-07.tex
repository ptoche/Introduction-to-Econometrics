Let $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n$ be i.i.d. draws from a distribution with mean $\mu$. A test of $H_0{:}~ \mu=5$ ~vs.~ $H_1{:}~ \mu \ne 5$ using the usual $t$-statistic yields a $p$-value of $0.03$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does the $95\%$ confidence interval contain $\mu=5$? Explain.
\item Can you determine if $\mu=6$ is contained in the $95\%$ confidence interval? Explain.
\end{enumerate}
