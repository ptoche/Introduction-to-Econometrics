\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Confidence set:} A set of values that contains the true population mean $\mu_Y$ with a certain pre-specified probability. 
\item \emph{Confidence level:} The pre-specified probability that $\mu_Y$ is contained in the confidence set.
\item \emph{Confidence interval:} The confidence set contains all the possible values of the mean between a lower and an upper limit --- it is an interval.
\item \emph{Coverage probability:} The coverage probability of a confidence interval for the population mean is the probability, computed over all possible random samples, that it contains the true population mean.
\item A $95\%$ two-sided confidence interval for $\mu_Y$ is an interval constructed so that it contains the true value of $\mu_Y$ in $95\%$ of all possible random samples. 
\begin{align*}
90\% ~\text{confidence interval for}~ \mu_Y: & \{\mean{Y} \pm 1.64 \SE(\mean{Y})\}\\
95\% ~\text{confidence interval for}~ \mu_Y: & \{\mean{Y} \pm 1.96 \SE(\mean{Y})\}\\
99\% ~\text{confidence interval for}~ \mu_Y: & \{\mean{Y} \pm 2.58 \SE(\mean{Y})\}
\end{align*}
