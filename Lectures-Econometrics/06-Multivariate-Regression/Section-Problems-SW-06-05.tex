Data were collected from a random sample of $220$ home sales from a community in 2013. Let $\vn{Price}$ denote the selling price (in $\$1000$s), $\vn{BDR}$ denote the number of bedrooms, $\vn{Bath}$ denote the number of bathrooms, $\vn{Hsize}$ denote the size of the house (in square feet), $\vn{Lsize}$ denote the lot size (in square feet), $\vn{Age}$ denote the age of the house (in years), and $\vn{Poor}$ denote a binary variable that is equal to $1$ if the condition of the house is reported as ``poor.'' An estimated regression yields:
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{Price}} 
  = & 119.2 + 0.485\,\vn{BDR} + 23.4\,\vn{Bath} + 0.156\,\vn{Hsize} \\
    & \quad + 0.002\,\vn{Lsize} + 0.090\,\vn{Age} - 48.8\,\vn{Poor}
  \quad \bar{R}^2 = 0.72,
  \quad \vn{SER} = 41.5
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose a homeowner converts part of an existing family room in her house into a new bathroom. What is the expected increase in the value of the house?
\item Suppose a homeowner adds a new bathroom to her house, which increases the size of the house by $100$ square feet. What is the expected increase in the value of the house?
\item What is the loss in value if a homeowner lets his house run down, so that its condition becomes ``poor''?
\item Compute the $R^{2}$ for the regression.
\end{enumerate}
