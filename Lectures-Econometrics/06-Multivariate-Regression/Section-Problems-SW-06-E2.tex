Using the data set \textbf{Growth}, but excluding the data for Malta, carry out the following exercises. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct a table that shows the sample mean, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum values for the series $Growth$, $TradeShare$, $YearsSchool$, $Oil$, $Rev\_Coups$, $Assassinations$, and $RGDP60$. Include the appropriate units for all entries.
\item Run a regression of $Growth$ on $TradeShare$, $YearsSchool$, $Rev\_Coups$, $Assassinations$, and $RGDP60$. What is the value of the coefficient on $Rev\_Coups$? Interpret the value of this coefficient. Is it large or small in a real-world sense?
\item Use the regression to predict the average annual growth rate for a country that has average values for all regressors.
\item Repeat (c), but now assume that the country's value for $TradeShare$ is one standard deviation above the mean.
\item Why is $Oil$ omitted from the regression? What would happen if it were included?
\end{enumerate}
