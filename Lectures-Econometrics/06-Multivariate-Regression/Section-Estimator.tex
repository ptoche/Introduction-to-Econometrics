\emph{OLS Estimator:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The method of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) selects $k+1$ estimators $\hat{\beta}_{0}, \hat{\beta}_{1},\ldots, \hat{\beta}_{k}$, to minimize the sum of the squared residuals from the regression function:
\begin{align*}
\min_{\hat{\beta}_{0}, \hat{\beta}_{1},\ldots, \hat{\beta}_{k}}\;
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{u}_{i}^{2}
\end{align*}
\item The OLS estimates are computed from a sample of $n$ observations for each of the $k$ regressors $X_{1i},\ldots,X_{ki}$ and the regressand $Y_{i}$.
\item The $n$ residuals $\hat{u}_{i}$ are:
\begin{align*}
\hat{u}_{i} = Y_{i} - \hat{Y}_{i}, i=1,\ldots,n
\end{align*}
\item Equivalently:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(Y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \beta_{1} X_{1i} - \beta_{k} X_{ki}\right)^{2}
\to \min
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
