Consider the regression of average hourly earnings $\vn{AHE}$ (in dollars) on $\vn{Age}$ (in years) and several binary variables for characteristics such as sex, education, and region of employment:
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{AHE}} 
  = 0.33 & + 10.42\,\vn{College} - 4.57\,\vn{Female} + 0.61\,\vn{Age}\\ 
         & + 0.74\,\vn{Northeast} - 1.54\,\vn{Midwest} - 0.44\,\vn{South}\\
  \quad R^2 = 0.185, &
  \quad \vn{SER} = 12.01, 
  \quad n = 7178
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Do there appear to be important regional differences?
\item Why is the regressor $\vn{West}$ omitted from the regression? What would happen if it were included?
\item Juanita is a $28$-year-old female college graduate from the $\vn{South}$. Jennifer is a $28$-year-old female college graduate from the $\vn{Midwest}$. Calculate the expected difference in earnings between Juanita and Jennifer.
\end{enumerate}
