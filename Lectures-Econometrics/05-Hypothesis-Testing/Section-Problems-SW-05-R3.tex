Outline the procedures for computing the $p$-value of a two-sided test of $H0\colon\mu_{Y}=0$ using an i.i.d. set of observations $Yi$, $i=1,\ldots,n$. Outline the regression model using an i.i.d. set of observations $Y_{i},X_{i}$, $i=1,\ldots,n$.

Define homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity. Provide a hypothetical empirical example in which you think the errors would be heteroskedastic, and explain your reasoning.

\exercise{Wooldridge, Introduction (7th), Chapter~8, Problem~1.}
Which of the following are consequences of heteroskedasticity?
\begin{enumerate}
\item The OLS estimators, $\hat{\beta}_{i}$, are inconsistent.
%\item The usual $F$ statistic no longer has an $F$ distribution.
\item The OLS estimators are no longer BLUE.
\end{enumerate}
