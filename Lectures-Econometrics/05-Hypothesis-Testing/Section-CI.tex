\frametitle{Confidence Interval for Slope Coefficient}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Confidence Interval for  $\beta_{1}$:}\\
An interval that contains the true value of $\beta_{1}$ with a given probability. 
\begin{emphalign*}
\hat{\beta}_{1} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \times \SE(\beta_{1})
\end{emphalign*}
\item The probability is related to the significance level: $P=1-\alpha$. 
\item Popular values are $90\%$, $95\%$, and $99\%$. 
\item For $\alpha=0.05$, the true value of $\beta_{1}$ is contained in $95\%$ of all possible samples.
\item Confidence Interval for $\beta_{1}$ in the regression of $\vn{TestScore}$ on $\vn{STR}$:
\begin{align*}
\beta_{1} \in
(-2.28 & \pm 1.96 \times 0.52)\\
\implies 
  -3.30 & < \beta_{1} < -1.26
\end{align*}
for $t_{0.05}\approx1.96$. 
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Confidence Interval for Predicted Change}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Confidence Interval for predicted effect of a change in $X$:}
\begin{align*}
\left[\hat{\beta}_{1} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \times \SE(\beta_{1})\right] \times \Delta X
\end{align*}
\item Confidence Interval for $\beta_{1}\Delta X$ in the regression of $\vn{TestScore}$ on $\vn{STR}$, with $t_{0.05}\approx1.96$:
\begin{align*}
-2.28\Delta X  - 1.96 \times 0.52 \Delta X 
    & < \beta_{1} \Delta X
      < -2.28\Delta X  + 1.96 \times  0.52 \Delta X\\
-3.30 \Delta X 
    & < \beta_{1} \Delta X < -1.26 \Delta X
\end{align*}
Thus, for $\Delta X = -2$, the confidence interval for the predicted change is:
\begin{align*}
  6.60 < \beta_{1} \Delta X < 2.52
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
