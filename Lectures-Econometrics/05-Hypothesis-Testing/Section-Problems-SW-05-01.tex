A researcher, using data on class size (CS) and average test scores from $100$ third-grade classes, estimates the OLS regression:
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{TestScore}} 
  = \muse{520.4}{20.4} - \muse{5.82}{2.21} \times CS,
  \quad R^2 = 0.08,
  \quad \vn{SER} = 11.5
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct a $95\%$ confidence interval for $\beta_1$, the regression slope coefficient.
\item Calculate the p-value for the two-sided test of the null hypothesis
$H_0\colon \beta_1 = 0$. Do you reject the null hypothesis at the $5\%$ level? At the $1\%$ level?
\item Calculate the p-value for the two-sided test of the null hypothesis 
$H_0\colon \beta_1=-5.6$. Without doing any additional calculations, determine whether $-5.6$ is contained in the $95\%$ confidence interval for $\beta_1$.
\item Construct a $99\%$ confidence interval for $\beta_0$.
\end{enumerate}
