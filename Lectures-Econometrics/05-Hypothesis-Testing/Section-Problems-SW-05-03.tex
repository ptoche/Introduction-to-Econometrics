Suppose a random sample of $200$ $20$-year-old men is selected from a population and their heights and weights are recorded. A regression of weight on height yields
\begin{align*}
\verywidehat{\vn{Weight}} 
  = -\muse{99.41}{2.15} + \muse{3.94}{0.31} \times \vn{Height},
  \quad R^2 = 0.81,
  \quad \vn{SER} = 10.2
\end{align*}
where $\vn{Weight}$ is measured in pounds and $\vn{Height}$ is measured in inches. Two of your classmates differ in height by $1.5$ inches. Construct a $99\%$ confidence interval for the difference in their weights.
